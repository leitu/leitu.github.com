# How to reference the right thing

I'm not really familiar with front end thing, as I knew from the github/bitbucket, you can directly point the line number for your code, like

`https://github.com/leitu/azure-cli-cookbooks/blob/master/recipes/default.rb#L9`

Actually if you right click with **Inspect**, you will find the element with

`<td id="L9" class="blob-num js-line-number" data-line-number="9"></td>`

That is the actually line you called, which means if you are knowing the id, you can actually point the right place with the right reference

Like below
